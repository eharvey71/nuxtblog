### Resources
- Built using the following Vue Mastery Lesson: [Build a Blog with Nuxt 3 and Nuxt Content 2](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/build-a-blog-nuxt3-content/nuxt3-blog-introduction)
- Repo for this build: [nuxtblog](https://github.com/eharvey71/nuxtblog). I've put HTML comments in the code of some of the components, for Vue/Nuxt noobs that are still learning, like me. The comments mostly involve reactivity and working with reactive refs.
- Deployed: [Netlify App](https://master--effulgent-bombolone-6ad124.netlify.app/)

### Build notes
- Inside of app.vue's script setup is the useHead() "macro" that was put there by Nuxt
  - Directs rendering to put meta items into the HTML head.
  - Incredibly powerful for scaling and updating of specific pages
- The pages directory is automatically generated by Nuxt 3 for routing.
- index.vue is the root page
- Using Bulma CSS
- Nuxt content is built to allow the ability to use local files to ingest data.
- TS files are using normal javascript, typed files are used for our protection :)
- Markdown for pages are using "frontmatter". A YAML-style syntax that looks like this. Properties are defined here for doing awesome things like definging meta-attributes, etc:

```yaml
